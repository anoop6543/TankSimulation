# Two-Tank System Simulation

## Description
This project simulates a two-tank system with real-time visualization and interactive controls. It models two tanks with different filling rates and control mechanisms, providing a graphical interface to observe changing water levels over time. The simulation includes features such as power loss simulation, sensor failure scenarios, and audible alarms for critical tank levels.

## Features
- Real-time visualization of tank levels
- Interactive controls for power loss and sensor failure simulation
- Audible alarms for critical tank levels (90%, 95%, 100%)
- Fail-safe mechanisms to prevent overflow
- Customizable tank parameters and control logic

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- PyQt5
- pyqtgraph
- numpy

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
      git clone https://github.com/anoop6543/tanksimulation.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
* pip install PyQt5 pyqtgraph numpy


## Usage
Run the simulation:

python TankSimulation_Live_Improved.py

## Controls
- **Stop Simulation**: Ends the simulation and closes the application
- **Simulate Power Loss**: Toggles power on/off in the system
- **Simulate Sensor Failure**: Simulates a sensor malfunction
